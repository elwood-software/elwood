## Getting Started

To ensure a positive and inclusive environment, please read our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. For help setting up the code in this repo, please follow our [DEVELOPERS.md](./DEVELOPERS.md) file. If you run into any problems along the way, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to us directly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mkhKk5db) or at [hello@elwood.software](mailto:hello@elwood.software).

## Ways to Help

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/elwood-software/elwood/issues/new/choose) and we’ll triage it.

- Please [search existing Issues](https://github.com/elwood-software/elwood/issues) before creating a new one.
- Please include a clear description of the problem along with steps to reproduce it. Exact steps with screenshots and urls really help here.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We actively welcome your Pull Requests! A couple of things to keep in mind before you submit:

- If you’re fixing an Issue, make sure someone else hasn’t already created a PR fixing the same issue. Likewise, make sure to link your PR to the related Issue(s).
- We will always try to accept the first viable PR that resolves the Issue.
- If you're new, we encourage you to take a look at issues tagged with good first issue.
- If you’re submitting a new feature, make sure you have opened a Discussion to discuss the new feature before opening a PR. We’d love to accept your hard work, but unfortunately if a feature hasn’t gone through a proper design process, your PR will be closed.
- Please use the PR message template and provide detailed context for quicker review. PRs without clear problem statements will be closed.

Prior to submitting your PR, please conduct the following pre-flight checks:

- Run npm run build locally to ensure that your code builds successfully without having to wait on us to approve Vercel Preview deploys.
- Ensure that the Prettier tests run successfully on your PR.

Running these before you create the PR will help reduce back and forth with the team.
